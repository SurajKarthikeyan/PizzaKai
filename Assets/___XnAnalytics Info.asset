    text: '<b>XnAnalytics</b> is a script that allows you to log a row of data to
      a specified Google Sheet. Everything that is actually essential is included
      in the <b>XnAnalytics.cs</b> script file, including step-by-step instructions,
      sample scripts (commented out), and the required Google App Script.


      One
      of the very cool aspects of XnAnalytics is that <i>any</i> field added to the
      WWWForm class that is posted to the Sheet will be automatically added as a
      column in the Sheet itself.

    text: "Instructions and the Google Apps Script required to make this work in
      the <b>XnAnalytics.cs</b> file. You must follow those instructions, set up
      a Google Sheet, and set the <i>Sheets Url</i> field of the XnAnalytics component
      for this to work.\n\nExamples of use can be found in:\n\u2013 ReportButtonClick.cs
      : Clicked()\n\u2013 ReportEveryTimeKeyIsPressed.cs : Update()\n\u2013 BugReportPanel.cs
      : SubmitFeedback()"

    text: This is a simple bug report tool that you can add to any project. It will
      allow your players to report bugs from within the game that will be posted
      to a flexible Google Sheet.

  - heading: Required Additional Assets for BugReporter
    text: "While XnAnalytics.cs will work just fine by itself, in order to use the
      BugReporter example, you should also install TextMeshPro from the Window >
      Package Manager (which Unity should automatically ask you to do).\n\nIf you
      need to allow iOS players to type text into an input field in WebGL, I highly
      recommend the WebGLInput project by keo-yeung:\n    https://github.com/kou-yeung/WebGLInput"
