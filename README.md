# Pizzakai OG Branch

This branch contains the "original" code, back when everything still worked and before Ryan fucked everything up (the bastard).

It's purpose is so that we can incorporate some of the older aspects of the game into the new version. I still think it's a bad idea to restart from this point, as (almost) everything now works in the rc_ai_2 branch.
